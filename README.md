# modbot

Automation software for Everquest, based on ModBot.

Credits for original code are many and noted below. Initially, my aim is simply to pull in all the needed changes since the code was last actively maintained, circa November, 2013.
Once that phase is complete, I will attempt to remove code that is no longer needed. I hope to then evaluate if certain things can be done natively, allowing us to drop some plugins.

## Installation

Clone the repo and copy the files to your MQ2 "release/macros" directory.

## Usage

Lots of information is available, here are some of the best places to look:

Wiki: http://www.macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/ModBot
Post: http://eqtitan.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=1086

The wiki contains links to example ini files per character class which can help you get started.

## Troubleshooting

Known errors will be noted in this section.

## Development

After checking out the repo, create a branch (consider naming after your feature), update the code, push your branch, and open a pull request.
